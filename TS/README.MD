### TypeScript Backend Template

**Don't use TypeScript? Check out the [Javascript version of this repo](https://github.com/willster277/javascript-backend-template)!**
This is a template for developing MongoDB+Express.js APIs in TypeScript.

Clone this repo, then run `npm i` to install dependencies. Next, you can run `npm start` to build and run the project, or `npm test` to use nodemon and ts-node to run TypeScript without building.
