# Will 'Willster' Johnson

### About Me

I go by Willster, I'm a 20-year-old self-taught full-stack web-developer who needs five hyphens to describe.

My expertise lies in web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node. I'm particularly drawn to Svelte and SvelteKit for web app development, but I also have some experience in React and Vue, and I'm currently learning Qooxdoo.

Apart from my main projects, I love tinkering with smaller projects too. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages including Rust, C#, Python, Dart, VBA, and PHP. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to experiment with.

When I'm not busy with more sensible projects, I enjoy playing with libraries and APIs I find interesting. Be it Discord bots, VSCode and Obsidian plugins and themes, automation scripts, building browser extensions, even headless browser puppeteers. Basically, anything that involves tinkering with code is a prime target for me.

### What's My 'Big Project'?

My big project is [Type The Platform](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform), it's parser-compiler engine [RuleComp](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform/RuleComp), and a RuleComp plugin kit for typed web development [SupaSet](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform/SupaSet).

RuleComp is an endlessly pluggable and extensible compiler which aims to make compiler authoring as simple as possible.
SupaSet is a plugin kit for RuleComp with aims to provide an effective typing solution to JavaScript.
Type The Plaform is the organisation I have created for doing this.

The rationale behind SupaSet is that TypeScript and JSDoc are limited, slow to introduce community-desired features, and not extensible by a community-driven ecosystem.
The rationale behind RuleComp is that if I've got to build a compiler/interpreter/parser for SupaSet anyway, I may as well continue the theme of pluggable extensibility.

### What Am I Wokring On Now?

I'm currently taking a break from Web programming to work on a Discord Bot using discord.js for a web development community I'm a part of.

### What Am I Working On Very Occasionally?

**[sk-mono](https://github.com/WillsterJohnson/sk-mono)**

sk-mono is a CLI for creating, managing, running, deploying, and distributing [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) apps and packages in a monorepo, designed accounting for compatibility with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)'s best-in-class efficiency for monorepo action management.

sk-mono is currently in the early stages of development, and is not recommended for use in professional projects.

**D.I.M.E.N.S.I.O.N.S.**

*Stands for "Data Interaction and Modification Engine with Normalised Syntax for Intricate Operations and Novel Systems"*

D.I.M.E.N.S.I.O.N.S. (or just "dimensions" to save time) is a programming language I am designing.
It sits in an awkward space between general purpose and domain specific; it will be able to do any arbitrary operations, however it's designed for web interfaces to databases & API data.
The goal of dimensions is to provide high-level concepts and abilities as highly-efficient core functionality in a compiled language. It's syntax is designed to be easy, sensible, and largely optional, while it's compilation and runtime are designed to be efficient, fast, and bare-bones.
In effect, Dimensions is an ORM DSL with general-purpose superpowers.

Dimensions is currently in initial design, and will remain closed-source for the forseeable future. Licensing and distribution are yet to be decided.
