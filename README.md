# Will 'Willster' Johnson

### About Me

I go by Willster, I'm 20 years old, and I'm a self-taught fullstack web developer.

I am most proficient in web technologies (TS, JS, HTML, CSS, Node) and have the most interest in Svelte & SvelteKit for webapp development.
I am also currently learning Rust, and have dabbled before in C#, Python, and PHP.

### What Am I Wokring On Now?

I'm currently working on [sk-mono](https://github.com/WillsterJohnson/sk-mono).
sk-mono is a CLI built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for creating, managing, running, deploying, and distributing [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) apps and packages in a monorepo, designed accounting for compatibility with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)'s best-in-class efficiency for monorepo action management.
sk-mono is currently in early alpha, and is not yet ready for use.

### Contributions & Most used languages
