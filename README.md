# Will 'Willster' Johnson

### About Me

I go by Willster, I'm a 20-year-old self-taught\* full-stack web-developer who needs five hyphens to describe.

My expertise lies in web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node. I'm particularly drawn to Svelte and SvelteKit for web app development, but I also have some experience in React and Vue, along with several other NPM libraries.

Apart from my main projects, I love tinkering with smaller projects too. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages including Rust, C#, Python, Dart, VBA, and PHP. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to experiment with.

When I'm not busy with more sensible projects, I enjoy playing with libraries and APIs I find interesting. Be it Discord bots, VSCode and Obsidian plugins and themes, automation scripts, building browser extensions, even headless browser puppeteers. Basically, anything that involves tinkering with code is a prime target for me.

> \* While I am primarily self taught, I have a T-Level Merit (UK Higher Education Certificate) in Digital Design, Production, & Development, and am currently studying with The Open University to achieve a BSc (Undergraduate Certificate) in Computing, aiming to graduate with a 1st by 2026.

### What's My 'Big Project'?

*Currently in desgin, this will take quite some time.*

My big project is [Type The Platform](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform), it's parser-transpiler engine [RuleComp](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform/RuleComp), and a RuleComp plugin kit for typed web development [SupaSet](https://github.com/TypeThePlatform/SupaSet).

RuleComp is an endlessly pluggable and extensible transpiler which aims to make transpiler authoring as simple as possible.
SupaSet is a plugin kit for RuleComp with aims to provide an effective typing solution to JavaScript.
Type The Plaform is the organisation I have created to own this.

The rationale behind SupaSet is that TypeScript and JSDoc are limited, slow to introduce community-desired features, and not extensible by a community-driven ecosystem.
The rationale behind RuleComp is that if I've got to build a transpiler/interpreter/parser for SupaSet anyway, I may as well continue the theme of pluggable extensibility.

### What Am I Wokring On Now?

I'm currently focusing most of my hobby-time programming on [Smelterial](https://github.com/Smelterial/smelterial), which aims to bring not only the full and specification-strict range of Material You design components to Svelte, but also to build a collection of composite components from these tokens, providing instant access to the majority of common use cases.

### What Am I Working On Very Occasionally?

**All-RC**

Config files suck.

They take up far to much room in your project directories, every library has it's own file, and nobody can agree on which file format to use.
My current focus, Smelterial, is expected to have around 200 config files before any composite components or non-component tools are built. This is unacceptable.

All-RC says forget that, lets have one single file with all of our configurations, and lets use all the magic we can find to bolt compatibility onto nearly anything without the tool authors even knowing All-RC exists.

All-RC is still being specified, and will not have a stable API for some time.

**ARGON**

*Accessible Remote GitHub Organizer for Noobs*

Don't you wish GitHub desktop was a little less GitHub-focused and a little more get-things-done-easily-focused?
Maybe not, you might be a whizz with the command line. But some folks aren't, and they don't have to be.

Argon is built with SvelteKit, Vite, and Tauri to provide a single, beautiful, and plugabble application for managing your projects, your contributions, and only the parts of GitHub you care about.

Argon is in-development, but it's UI (and consequently, much of the rest of it) is put on hold to wait for Smelterial to mature into a more usable UI Library.

**My website**

My website is [willsterjohnson.com](https://willsterjohnson.com), and by visiting it you might see that it hasn't been updated in a while.
This is because making a website about myself isn't fun, interesting, useful, nor a learning opportunity. Why go though all the bother of building a website to describe myself when this markdown document does the same thing much more concisely and is embedded into my GitHub profile?
I'll get to it eventually, but ego-driven developement isn't my style. Much like Argon, my website can wait until Smelterial is more usable (can you tell I like Material You?).
