# Will 'Willster' Johnson

### About Me

I go by Willster, I'm a full-stack web-developer and general tinkerer.

My expertise lies in web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node. I'm particularly drawn to Svelte and SvelteKit for web app development, however I also have some experience in React and Vue, along with several other popular NPM libraries.

Apart from my main projects, I love tinkering with smaller projects too. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages including Rust, C#, Python, Dart, VBA, and PHP. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to experiment with.

When I'm not busy with more sensible projects, I enjoy playing with libraries and APIs I find interesting. Be it Discord bots, VSCode and Obsidian plugins and themes, automation scripts, building browser extensions, even headless browser puppeteers. Basically, anything that involves tinkering with code is a prime target for me. My greatest weakness is a library without TypeScript types - "I could port this to TypeScript!" is a phrase which has cost me countless hours.

While I am primarily self taught, I have a T-Level Merit (UK Level 3 Certificate) in Digital Design, Production, & Development, and am currently studying with The Open University to achieve a BSc in Computing, aiming to graduate with a 1st by 2026.
