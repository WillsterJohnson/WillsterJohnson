# Will 'Willster' Johnson

### About Me

I go by Willster, I'm a 20-year-old self-taught full-stack web-developer who needs five hyphens to describe.

My expertise lies in web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node. I'm particularly drawn to Svelte and SvelteKit for web app development, but I also have some experience in React and I'm currently learning Qooxdoo.

Apart from my main projects, I love tinkering with smaller projects too. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages including Rust, C#, Python, Dart, VBA, and PHP. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to experiment with.

When I'm not busy with more sensible projects, I enjoy playing with libraries and APIs I find interesting. Be it Discord bots, VSCode and Obsidian plugins and themes, automation scripts, building browser extensions, even headless browser puppeteers. Basically, anything that involves tinkering with code is a prime target for me.

### What Am I Wokring On Now?

**[sk-mono](https://github.com/WillsterJohnson/sk-mono)**

*Progress is slow; circumstances have changed and there is talk of SvelteKit directly improving it's monorepo capabilities*

sk-mono is a CLI built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for creating, managing, running, deploying, and distributing [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) apps and packages in a monorepo, designed accounting for compatibility with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)'s best-in-class efficiency for monorepo action management.

sk-mono is currently in early alpha, and is not yet ready for use.

**D.I.M.E.N.S.I.O.N.S.**

*Stands for "Data Interaction and Modification Engine with Normalised Syntax for Intricate Operations and Novel Systems"*

D.I.M.E.N.S.I.O.N.S. (or just "dimensions" to save time) is a DSL I am architecting which aims to provide the maximum flexibility of a data management system (eg, a store's stock tracker, a payroll system, a government vehicle registrar - anything like that) for the minimum amount of code.
It's key objectives are to abstract away the concept of server and client while remaining configurably secure, support the use of any database or API or combination thereof as the data-source, and to be both infinitely tweakable and easily usable without configuration.

Dimensions is currently in initial design, and will remain closed-source for the forseeable future. Licensing, distribution, and price (if any) are yet to be decided.
