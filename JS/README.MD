### JavaScript Backend Template

**Note: This template is built off of my [TypeScript Template](https://github.com/willster277/typescript-backend-template), as such it may contain unfamiliar conventions.**

This is a template for developing MongoDB+Express.js APIs in JavaScript.

Clone this repo, then run `npm i` to install dependencies. Next, you can run `npm start` to build and run the project, or `npm test` to use nodemon.
